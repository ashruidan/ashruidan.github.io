## Introduction

In Go, navigating the complex situations of the midgame requires the use of your **evaluation skill**. This skill involves analyzing the distribution of both territory and influence across the board. By mastering evaluation, players can assess who is leading, decide what groups or areas to attack or defend, and identify moves that can shift or maintain the balance of the game.

## Positional Judgment

**Positional judgment** forms the foundation of evaluation skills. It includes:

- **Assessing territory** : Understand what areas are already secured and estimate potential future gains.
- **Evaluating influence** : Recognize areas where future battles will take place and how strong each player’s position is in those zones.
- **Balancing influence and territory** : Gauge who is leading and how challenging it will be to either maintain or overturn that lead.

## Balance of Influence and Territory

The balance of influence and territory reflects the relative strength of each player’s positions. To evaluate this:

- Consider the secured territories and komi to estimate the current score difference.
- Assess influence to determine each player's potential, exposed weaknesses, and opportunities for future territory.

Combining these insights provides a clear picture of the game’s state, allowing you to decide on a move that exploits an opponent's weakness or targets the largest area to maximize gains.

## Proverb of the Day

> **"Greed for the win takes the win away."**

This proverb reminds us that excessive ambition often leads to overextension, creating vulnerabilities that opponents can exploit. In Go, balance and careful planning are often more effective than reckless attempts to secure a quick victory.
