## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the **Rule of Capture**, learning how liberties affect the capture of stones. However, not all captures are immediately obvious. In some situations, even if you try to save a stone, the opponent can force it into atari repeatedly until it’s ultimately captured. This is where the importance of **reading** begins.

## What is Reading ?

**Reading** is the ability to visualize sequences of moves in advance. It’s a fundamental skill in Go, enabling players to foresee outcomes and make informed decisions. For example, if a capture is unavoidable, a player can choose to play elsewhere to minimize losses. 

Reading isn’t just about seeing a few moves ahead; it’s about recognizing patterns and understanding the best responses. Beginners can start practicing reading with common capture techniques such as **ladders**, **nets**, and **double atari**, visualizing results without playing the moves physically.

Experienced players often know the outcome of these situations instinctively, but it all starts with practice.

## The Unavoidable Capture

This sequence demonstrates a situation where no matter how hard you try to save a stone, the result is inevitable if the opponent plays correctly. 

To help you master reading, let’s explore three essential capture techniques: the **ladder**, the **net**, and the **double atari**.

## The Ladder

The ladder is a sequence where a stone in atari tries to escape but is chased in a zig-zag pattern until it’s inevitably captured. Rather than explaining this pattern, I will let you do it :

- **Your challenge** : Try to save the white stone in atari. For Black, play the moves that block White’s escape.
- **Hint** : Block the direction where White is moving.
- **Answer** : Answers are at the end of the article.

White plays first. You can read the sequence in your mind or test it on a board.

But a ladder can be broken if a friendly stone is in the path of the ladder.

- **Your challenge**: Can you capture the white stone in this situation, or will White escape atari? White plays first.
- **Answer** : Answers are at the end of the article.
## Net

A **net** surrounds a stone, making escape impossible even when liberties seem available. The surrounding stones block all escape paths.

- **Your challenge**: Can the white stone escape from the net? Try to read out the sequence.

## The double atari

The simplest way to make a capture unavoidable is the **double atari**. Here, one move puts two groups in atari simultaneously. The opponent is forced to save one, leaving the other captured.

In the diagram:
- If White saves the stone at A, Black captures the stone at B. 
- If White saves the stone at B, Black captures the stone at A.

Reading helps you avoid entering double atari situations and guides you to make better decisions when forced to choose.

## Proverb of the Day

> "Read out every move before you play."

This proverb emphasizes the importance of thinking ahead. Rather than playing impulsively, take your time to evaluate possible outcomes. As your reading improves, you’ll find yourself making better decisions and gaining control over the game.
