## Introduction  

As you grow in your Go journey, you'll notice that Go is not just about claiming territory outright; it's also about creating potential. This potential often manifests as **influence**, **thickness**, and **moyo**, concepts that are critical to understanding deeper strategies in Go.

## Influence  

**Influence** refers to the ability of your stones to control or affect a wide area of the board. Instead of focusing on immediate territory, influence lays the groundwork for future expansions or attacks.

You can see the distinction between **territory** (squares) and **influence** (triangles). Territory is already secured; no further moves are required to claim it as your own. On the other hand, influence radiates outward, giving Black an advantage in controlling nearby areas. However, influence is not guaranteed territory, White can still reduce it. Black would need additional moves to solidify the area and transform influence into secure territory.
## Thickness  

**Thickness** is a form of influence that is solid, safe, and hard to attack. It comes from well connected stones with no weaknesses that your opponent can exploit.

The key difference with **thickness** compared to influence is that thickness contains potential **eyes** (squares), even if White successfully reduces its influence. This means thickness not only projects strength outward like influence but also maintains a defensive structure with built-in potential for life.
## Moyo  

**Moyo** (Japanese for "framework") is a large area of potential territory that has not been secured yet. It is built using influence and thickness to outline a broad section of the board.

## Proverb of the Day  

> **"Play away from thickness"**

This proverb advises players to avoid placing stones directly near thick positions. Playing close to your own thickness results in inefficient moves, as the area is already secure and influential. On the other hand, playing near your opponent's thickness makes your stones vulnerable to attack without significantly impacting the strength of their group.
