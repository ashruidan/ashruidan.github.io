## Introduction

We’ve learned how to capture, how to read sequences, and how to make life by creating two eyes. Now it’s time to delve deeper into the concept of **life and death** and discover how identifying the **vital point** of a group can help you save your stones or kill your opponent’s.
## What is Life and Death?

In Go, **life and death** refers to whether a group of stones can survive or be captured. A group is considered alive if it can secure two eyes, while a group without sufficient space to make two eyes is doomed to die. It is critical to recognize the status of your group to get the initiative and play first the vital point to get the control into the life and death of your groups or opponent's groups.

## What is a Vital Point ?

A vital point is the key intersection that decides whether a group lives or dies. For example, it may be the move that ensures two eyes for your group or prevents your opponent from forming them.

As you can see in the diagram :
- Black played A, the vital point of his group, to save it.
- White played B, the vital point of his opponent, to kill it.

## Living Shapes

Let’s begin by understanding what makes a living shape and why it cannot be killed.

You can play A or B to kill but your opponent will have the other move to make it alive.

When it comes to killing a living shape, you have to find way to reduce the space it has into a dead shapes. Because there is more living shapes than dead shapes we will study dead shapes.

In the diagram, even if you play at point A or B to try and kill the group, your opponent can respond by playing the other point, securing two eyes and keeping the group alive. This is the essence of a living shape: it has enough space or structure to guarantee life regardless of your attempts to capture it.

To successfully kill a living shape, you must find a way to reduce its space or force it into a **dead shape**. Since there are far more living shapes than dead ones, we’ll focus on studying the patterns of dead shapes.

## Dead Shapes

Certain shapes are often critical in determining life and death. These shapes may seem alive at first glance, but it depends on who play the vital point first.

Let’s examine common dead shapes and their vital points by their eyespace size :

1. **Eyespace of Three**  
   
   ![day04_deadshape3](/images/day04_deadshape3.png)
   
   It is easy to understand why the vital point of a group with only three-intersection in its eyespace is important.

2. **Eyespace of Four**  
   
   ![day04_deadshape4](/images/day04_deadshape4.png)
   
   In the special case of a four-intersection square, two moves are required to create two eyes, but a single move by the opponent at the vital point is enough to kill the group.
   
   We can observe that the vital point in a four-intersection shape is positioned similarly to that in a three-intersection shape. This reveals an important principle: larger shapes can often be understood as combinations of smaller ones.

3. **Eyespace of Five**

4. **Eyespace of Six and Seven**

By studying these patterns, you’ll learn not only to recognize groups at risk but also to predict the outcome based on who controls the vital points.

> "The opponent's key point is yours."

A move that prevent your survival often ensures your group's life, and same for your opponent.
