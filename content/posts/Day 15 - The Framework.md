## Introduction

**Frameworks** (or _moyo_) are large-scale structures that outline potential territory without completely enclosing it. We’ll explore the key ideas behind frameworks, including **sector lines**, the difference between **invasion** and **reduction**, and how to navigate this exciting aspect of the game.

## Sector Lines

**Sector lines** are imaginary boundaries that show the potential reach of your stones. They’re not actual walls but suggest areas where your opponent’s moves could threaten your potential territory.

You can see the sector lines of Black's framework (circle between K14 and O3).

## Invasion

An **invasion** involves playing deep inside an opponent’s framework with the aim of creating a living group.

White invades deep into Black's framework. If White can live, Black’s potential territory is significantly reduced.

## Reduction

When invading is too risky, a **reduction** offers a safer way to undermine an opponent’s framework.

White plays a reduction move that limits Black's influence.

## Framework Weakness

By exploiting the weaknesses in the groups that make up the framework, you can reduce its potential profit through reduction, invasion, or a combination of both.

## Proverb of the Day

> **"Invade a moyo one move before it becomes territory"**

This proverb advises players to approach large frameworks with caution. The larger the moyo, the more tempting it is to invade. However, it also reflects a significant investment of stones by your opponent. Attacking at the right moment, when you can gain substantial benefits, allows you to undermine your opponent’s efforts while maximizing the profit.
