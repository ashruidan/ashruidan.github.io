## Introduction  

Now that we’ve covered the fundamental rules and concepts of Go, it’s time to learn how to apply them in actual gameplay. Playing against others is not just about following the rules, it’s a way to reinforce and master the skills you’ve learned so far.
## Rule Settings

When playing Go, several settings determine how the game is scored, how ties are resolved, and whether the game is balanced for players of different skill levels. Let's explore these settings.

### Komi

To balance the inherent advantage of playing first, the second player (White) is given a **komi**, an additional number of points added to their final score.  

- In most games, **komi is set to 6.5 or 7.5 points**.  
- The fractional value ensures there are no ties.

### Scoring

In Go, the winner is determined by who controls the most territory. However, the method of counting varies based on the ruleset. Here are the two most common ways of scoring:  

#### Japanese Rules (Territory Scoring)  

Under Japanese rules, your score is the sum of :  

- The total number of **empty points surrounded by your stones** (your territory).  
- The number of **captured and dead stones** of your opponent (prisoners).  

This scoring system emphasizes identifying and removing dead stones from the board before counting.  

#### Chinese Rules (Area Scoring)  

Under Chinese rules, your score is the sum of :  

- The total number of **empty points surrounded by your stones** (your territory).  
- The total number of **stones you have on the board** (both alive and captured dame points filled by your stones).  

This method makes counting easier for beginners since you don’t need to distinguish between captured and dead stones during the counting phase.

### Dame  

**Dame** refers to neutral points on the board, located between Black's and White's territories. These points are neither controlled by either player nor considered part of their territories.  

Under **Japanese rules**, dame points do not affect the score and are typically ignored unless filled unnecessarily.  

Under **Chinese rules**, **dame points contribute to the score**. Placing stones on dame points increases the player's stone count, which factors into their area score.

In the diagram above, the circled point is dame. Under Japanese rules, these points are neutral and do not impact the score. Under Chinese rules, filling these points increases the score of the player who places their stones there.
