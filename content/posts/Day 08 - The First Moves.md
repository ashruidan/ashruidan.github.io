## Introduction  

Now that you have a rudimentary knowledge of the game, you may feel ready to try playing on a larger board. But a common question arises: **Where should I place my first stones on the board, and why?**  
## Where to Play  

In Go, you can play anywhere on the board. However, if you observe experienced players, you’ll notice they often place their opening moves around the corner's **hoshi** points.  

**Hoshi**, meaning "star" in Japanese, refers to specific points on the board, often called star points.

The **4-4 point**, marked as hoshi in the corner's larger boards, is a common starting position.

## Why Play There?  

The choice of where to play is influenced by strategy and efficiency. Let’s explore the reasoning:  

### Corner vs. Side vs. Center  

With the same number of stones (e.g., 4 stones), you can enclose more territory in the **corner** than on the **side** or in the **center**.

- 4 stones in the **corner** can potentially control **4 intersections**.  
- 4 stones on the **side** can only control **2 intersections**.  
- 4 stones in the **center** controls just **1 intersection**.  

This means the corner offers better stability and efficiency in creating two eyes, which is crucial for life.

### Balancing Stability and Speed  

While the corner provides stability, the goal of Go is to secure more territory than your opponent. Focusing solely on stability may not be enough, you need to play **fast** to claim a larger share of the board.

Getting a bigger share of the board early gives you more room to expand and makes it harder for your opponent to catch up. By securing key areas like corners or important points, you take control of the game and force your opponent to react to your moves. Playing too safely might let your opponent take over the board, so balancing between stability and speed is important.

## Practice  

By using the online platforms like [OGS](https://online-go.com) :  

- Play games where you focus on your first moves, by experimenting playing the hoshi and intersections around it while aiming for balancing between stability and speed. 
- You can also observe games played by experienced players and take note of their opening moves.

## Proverb of the Day  

> **"Corners, then sides, then center."**  

This proverb reflects the strategic priority in the early stages of the game. It reminds players to focus on the corners first, then expand to the sides, and finally contest the center as the board develops.
