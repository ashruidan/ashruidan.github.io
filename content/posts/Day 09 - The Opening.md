## Introduction  

Now that you understand the importance of the first moves and balancing stability and speed, it’s time to explore how these concepts come together in the opening. In this chapter, we’ll look at common corner positions, how they shape your plans, and how to extend your influence toward the sides and the center.
## Starting in the Corner  

The corner is the best starting point in Go because it provides natural boundaries for forming territory. Different common corner moves, **hoshi (4-4)**, **komoku (4-3)**, and **sansan (3-3)**, each have unique strengths and weaknesses: 

- **Hoshi (4-4)** : Emphasizes influence, targeting the side and center rather than immediate territory. It offers flexibility and opportunities to expand outward. The triangles in the diagram indicate potential moves to either secure the corner or challenge it. Since hoshi is symmetrical, an attack on one side can often be countered by defending the opposite side.

- **Komoku (4-3)** : Balances influence and stability. It secures part of the corner while setting up an extension along the side. The triangles highlight possible responses to protect or contest the position. However, because komoku is asymmetrical, it is more vulnerable to targeted attacks compared to hoshi.

- **Sansan (3-3)** : Focuses on quick and secure corner territory, sacrificing broader influence on the board’s sides and center. Its proximity to the corner makes it less attractive for an opponent to attack directly, as there’s little value to gain.

Each of these corner moves invites specific responses from the opponent, whether aiming to reinforce or weaken the corner.

## Extending to the Side  

Once the corners are established, players use them as leverage to extend along the sides of the board. These extensions:  

1. **Reinforce the corner**: Strengthening your existing territory and influence.  
2. **Expand into new territory**: Creating area for additional points along the side.  

The distance of an extension is crucial. A well-placed extension is close enough to connect with the corner for stability but far enough to maximize territory.

The local follow-up sequence of moves in the corner are called **Joseki** when the result is balanced, which will be explored in more detail in the next chapter.

## Reaching the Center  

After securing the corners and sides, players gradually extend into the center if they have the advantage or goes into the midgame. The center offers less immediate territory but plays a critical role in influencing part of the board and connecting groups across the board. Extensions into the center often create areas of potential territory or walls of stones for attacking or defending groups.

In this diagram, after defending at move 18, White has two strategic options :

1. **Attack a Black group**: For instance, White could target the Black stone at 17, aiming to pressure or capture it, which can disrupt Black’s structure.
2. **Expand toward the center**: By playing at K15, White can extend into the center, creating a larger framework to secure a significant area in the upper-left corner of the board.
## Transitioning to the Midgame  

The opening transitions into the midgame when one player invades or challenges the potential territory of the other. For example:  

- **Invading a side or corner**: Placing a stone deep within the opponent’s territory to reduce their points or threaten their groups. 
- **Attacking weak groups**: Targeting an opponent’s group that lacks two eyes or solid connections to force them into a defensive position.  

Understanding the balance between securing your territory and disrupting your opponent’s is key to mastering the opening.  

## Proverb of the Day

> "Don't get surrounded in the opening"

This proverb highlights the importance of avoiding situations where your stones become encircled by your opponent during the opening. Being surrounded restricts your stones' effectiveness to just the corner while allowing your opponent's outward-facing stones to exert influence over larger areas, setting them up for future advantages. Focus on maintaining flexibility and spreading your stones to maximize their potential.
