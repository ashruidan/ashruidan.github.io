## Proverb of the Day

> **"Learning of joseki makes you weaker"**

This proverb reminds us that joseki are not rigid rules to rote memorize. Simply knowing the moves without understanding their purpose can lead to predictable and ineffective play. Instead, studying joseki teaches you to evaluate local situations, recognize patterns, and adapt them to the overall game.
