## Introduction  

With the knowledge we’ve gained, we are now equipped to understand the end of the game. The final phase is where players consolidate their territories, resolve conflicts, and prepare for the scoring phase. This is where **counting skill** becomes invaluable, allowing players to determine the game’s outcome even before the board is completely settled.  

## Territory and the Endgame  

In Go, the endgame is about solidifying **territory**. This means closing off any remaining gaps in your claimed areas, resolving any ongoing ko fights, and securing contested spaces.

In this diagram, both Black and White have secured 6 points, and there are no captured stones, resulting in a tied game, referred to as **jigo** in Japanese. If one side scores higher, the player with the greater score is declared the winner.

## The Importance of Counting  

Experienced players often count territory before the game ends. Using their reading skills, they estimate the final score by visualizing how the board will look once all areas are solidified. This requires knowledge of life and death situations and an understanding of the value of the remaining moves. This allows them to make informed decisions, such as whether to take risks, defend key areas, or settle ko fights.

## Value of a Move 

In the endgame, every move counts, making it essential to choose carefully. Prioritize moves that maximize your points, as each decision can significantly impact the final score.
Additionally, who plays first can greatly influence the board's outcome.

Compared to the previous diagram, White chose to play at 1 instead of 3. This decision changed the game's outcome, shifting the score from 6 points each in the first diagram to 6 points for White and 5 points for Black, resulting in a win for White.

## Proverb of the Day  

> "A single point can decide the game."

The result of a Go game is built upon the choices made throughout the game. However, the endgame holds the power to alter the outcome. If players fail to count or evaluate the value of each move, they risk losing crucial points. A single misstep or missed opportunity in the endgame can turn a winning position into a loss, emphasizing the importance of precision and foresight in the final phase.
